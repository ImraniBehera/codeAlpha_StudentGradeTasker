A Student Grade Tracker is a system, tool, or software designed to record, monitor, and analyze students' academic performance over time. It allows teachers, students, and sometimes parents to view grades for individual assignments, tests, and exams, as well as calculate overall performance metrics like average scores, rankings, or trends.

Key features are:
1)Grade Entry: Allows teachers or students to input grades for various assignments, quizzes, exams, or projects.
2)Data Storage: Stores the grades for each student, usually organized by course or subject.
Performance Metrics: 3)Calculates important statistics like average grade, highest and lowest grades, and cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average)

Usage:
1)Teachers use a grade tracker to monitor how students are performing throughout a term or academic year.
2)Students can also use it to keep track of their grades and know how they are doing in each subject, which helps them stay on top of their academic goals.
